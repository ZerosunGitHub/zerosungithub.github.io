# README  
You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.  
A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you communicate expectations for and manage contributions to your project.  
A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:  
What the project does  
Why the project is useful  
How users can get started with the project  
Where users can get help with your project  
Who maintains and contributes to the project  
If you put your README file in your repository's root, docs, or hidden .github directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.
